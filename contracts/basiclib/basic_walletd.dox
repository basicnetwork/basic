  basic-walletd is a local process that is used by basicd for verifying signatures and authorizing transactions.
  
  In order to sign transaction and push it to the blockchain, you will need to have the 'basic::wallet_api_plugin' loaded in basicd or alternatively have a basic-walletd process running on the local server.
 
  The command line arguments to basic-walletd are self explanatory and can be obtained by running ./basic-walletd â€“help
